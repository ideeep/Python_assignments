    "## Question 1\n",
    "**Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions offer reusability, modularity, abstraction, and testing benefits in programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "**When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in a function runs when it's called.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "**What statement creates a function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `def` statement creates a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "**What is the difference between a function and a function call?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code, while a function call is the execution of that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "**How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "One global scope and multiple local scopes (one for each function call).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "**What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Local scope variables are destroyed after the function call returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 7\n",
    "**What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A return value is what a function sends back to the caller. Yes, return values can be used in expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 8\n",
    "**If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 9\n",
    "**How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `global` keyword before the variable name inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 10\n",
    "**What is the data type of None?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data type of `None` is `NoneType`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 11\n",
    "**What does the sentence `import areallyourpetsnamederic` do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It raises an `ImportError` as it's not a valid module or package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 12\n",
    "**If you had a `bacon()` function in a `spam` module, what would you call it after importing `spam`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You would call it using `spam.bacon()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 13\n",
    "**What can you do to save a program from crashing if it encounters an error?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use error handling techniques like `try` and `except`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 14\n",
    "**What is the purpose of the `try` clause? What is the purpose of the `except` clause?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try` clause encloses code that might raise exceptions, and the `except` clause specifies how to handle those exceptions.\n"
